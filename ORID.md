## Objective
We implemented a project about a "parkingBoy", "SmartParkingBoy" and `SuperParkingBoy` class that extends `ParkingBoy`. This new class parks cars in the lot with the highest available position rate. We also wrote test cases to ensure it works correctly, covering scenarios like parking, fetching, and handling exceptions.

## Reflective
Curious.

## Interpretive
We learned how to extend a class and override methods to add new functionality. Calculating and comparing available position rates is crucial for optimal parking. Also , again, the testing is very important to validate functionality and catch potential issues early under the TDD we are using.

## Decisional
In the coming project, we will implement additional features or improvements based on feedback. We will continue writing comprehensive test cases for any new functionality and explore other optimization techniques for parking management. We will also review and refactor the code to ensure it adheres to best practices and is maintainable. Sharing the implementation and test cases with the team for feedback and further improvement is also on the agenda. Finally, we will document the process and findings to help others understand the implementation and its benefits.
